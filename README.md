* Developed a Sales Order Management App in Flutter with listing and creation functionality.

* Loaded initial JSON data into local sqflite; new orders are saved and shown after app restart.

* Implemented filters: All Orders, Today’s Orders, Pending Orders, and Delivered Orders.

* Built a New Sales Order page with form fields, auto-calculation of total, and local data persistence.

* Added real-time alerts for high-value orders (e.g., > ₹10,000) using pop-ups.

* Implemented daily sales summary pop-ups showing pending orders and total amount.

* Used Provider state management for dynamic UI updates and responsive experience.
